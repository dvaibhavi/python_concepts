Load testing is a technique used to test the performance of an application under different levels of load, i.e., to measure how well the application performs under heavy traffic or usage. In Python, we can use various tools to create and run load tests on an application. Here's an example using the Locust load testing framework:
<h5>

Use locust : for load testing

Use pytest, unit test, Robo framework : for testing

Use pylint : One way to test the architecture of a Python application is to use a tool like PyLint to analyze the code for adherence to coding standards and best practices

<div>
<p>
from locust import HttpUser, task, between
<br>
class MyUser(HttpUser):
<br>
    wait_time = between(1, 2.5)

    @task
    def my_task(self):
        self.client.get("/my-url")

    @task
    def another_task(self):
        self.client.post("/my-url", {"param": "value"})
</p>
</div>
In this example, we have defined a Locust test script that simulates user behavior by sending HTTP requests to the application. The MyUser class inherits from HttpUser, which provides methods for making HTTP requests. We define two @task methods that simulate different user actions, such as sending a GET request and a POST request.

The wait_time parameter defines the time that the user waits between requests, which can be useful for simulating realistic user behavior.

To run the load test, we need to install the Locust framework and then execute the locust command in the terminal with the filename of our test script:

<div>
<p> $ pip install locust </p>
<p> $ locust -f my_test_script.py </p>
</div>

This will start the Locust web interface, where we can configure the number of users to simulate, the hatch rate (i.e., how quickly to spawn new users), and the URL of the application being tested.

We can then start the load test and monitor the performance of the application under load. The Locust web interface provides real-time statistics and graphs showing the number of requests per second, response time, error rate, and other metrics.

By analyzing the load test results, we can identify performance bottlenecks and make improvements to the application to ensure it can handle the expected load.

eg:- locust -f load_testing.py
